              We collect information you provide directly to us, including your name, email address, organization name, 
              and any content you submit through our tools (strategic plans, assessments, grant materials). We also 
              collect standard usage data such as browser type, pages visited, and time spent on the platform.
            </p>

            <p>
              We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your personal information. 
              Your data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest. We use Supabase for secure data storage

              Our platform uses AI technology (powered by Anthropic's Claude) to provide strategic guidance and 
              analyze organizational assessments. Content you submit to our AI tools is processed to generate 
              your results and is not used to train AI models. Your organizational data remains private to your account.

              maintains their own privacy policies and data protection practices.
